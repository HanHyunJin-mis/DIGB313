        <h2>1. Favorite Things - Travel</h2>
            <h3>(1). Taiwan </h3>
            <div>
            <p>I have dreamed of traveling abroad since I was a high school student. Since then, I have visited many places, but the first trip to Taiwan with my friend was in January 2017.</p>
            <p>We ate a lot of Taiwanese foods such as beef noodle, Huoguo, mango bing-soo, and Feng Lishu there. </p>
            <p>And I went to Taipei 101, the Momochi Beachl, the sky lantern, and the Golden Museum. The picture below is taken in front of the Courage Memorial Hall. Although it rained a lot, we had a lot of fun together.

        <h3>(2). Japan </h3>
            <div>
            <p> 
                The second place I went with my friend was Fukuoka in Japan. Fukuoka went in February 2018 and was the place my friend had wanted to go. We always had bad weather with snow and rain.</p>
            <p>It also snowed a lot this time, but it was very hard because I planned to do it on a tight schedule. I had a hard time walking around for so long and having a lot of unexpected problems. </p>
            <p>In addition to the hard things, however, I tried various things like Fukuoka Tower, MomochI Beach, Hot Springs, and Ryukan, and ate Ramen, Gopchang jeongol, and Hamburg steak. </p>
            <p>But next time, I will plan my trip more comfortably.</p>

        <h2>2. What I Want To Do. </h2>
        <div>
        <p>At first, big data was a marketing class. Big data is useful in marketing. Big Data analytics is making a large amount of data valuable through analysis.</p>
        <p>The thing that makes a large amount of data valuable, I find it attractive. And I was surprised to know that it is being used in many fields other than marketing after attending IT conference. </p>
        <p>I were also interested in a variety of analytic tools, such as Hadoop and R, so he decided to pursue dual majors in my major in big data.</p> 
        <p>Big data is used in many fields, but I would like to extract valuable information from my favorite fields of travel. 
            </p>
